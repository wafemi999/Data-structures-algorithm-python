This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n\n#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n\n>  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This notebook is made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.\n\nTry executing the cells below:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import a library module\nimport math","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use a function from the library\nmath.sqrt(49)","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem \n\nThis course takes a coding-focused approach towards learning. In each notebook, we'll focus on solving one problem, and learn the techniques, algorithms, and data structures to devise an *efficient* solution. We will then generalize the technique and apply it to other problems.\n\n\n\nIn this notebook, we focus on solving the following problem:\n\n> **QUESTION 1:** Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mazym6s.png\" width=\"480\">\n\nThis may seem like a simple problem, especially if you're familiar with the concept of _binary search_, but the strategy and technique we learning here will be widely applicable, and we'll soon use it to solve harder problems.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Why You Should Learn Data Structures and Algorithms\n\nWhether you're pursuing a career in software development or data science, it's almost certain that you'll be asked to solve programming problems like *reversing a linked list* or *balancing a binary tree* in a technical interview or coding assessment.\n\nIt's well known, however, that you will almost never face these problems in your job as a software developer. So it's reasonable to wonder why such problems are asked in interviews and coding assessments. Solving programming problems demonstrates the following traits:\n\n1. You can **think about a problem systematically** and solve it systematically step-by-step.\n2. You can **envision different inputs, outputs, and edge cases** for programs you write.\n3. You can **communicate your ideas clearly** to co-workers and incorporate their suggestions.\n4. Most importantly, you can **convert your thoughts and ideas into working code** that's also readable.\n\nIt's not your knowledge of specific data structures or algorithms that's tested in an interview, but your approach towards the problem. You may fail to solve the problem and still clear the interview or vice versa. In this course, you will learn the skills to both solve problems and clear interviews successfully.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Method\n\nUpon reading the problem, you may get some ideas on how to solve it and your first instinct might be to start writing code. This is not the optimal strategy and you may end up spending a longer time trying to solve the problem due to coding errors, or may not be able to solve it at all.\n\nHere's a systematic strategy we'll apply for solving problems:\n\n1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.\n2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.\n3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.\n4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.\n5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.\n6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.\n\n_\"Applying the right technique\"_ is where the knowledge of common data structures and algorithms comes in handy. \n\nUse this template for solving problems by applying this method: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-problem-solving-template","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Solution\n\n\n### 1.

State it in plain English.\n\nOur first goal should always be to come up with a _correct_ solution to the problem, which may necessarily be the most _efficient_ solution. The simplest or most obvious solution to a problem, which generally involves checking all possible answers is called the _brute force_ solution.\n\nIn this problem, coming up with a correct solution is quite easy: Bob can simply turn over cards in order one by one, till he find a card with the given number on it. Here's how we might implement it:\n\n1. Create a variable `position` with the value 0.\n3. Check whether the number at index `position` in `card` equals `query`.\n4. If it does, `position` is the answer and can be returned from the function\n5. If not, increment the value of `position` by 1, and repeat steps 2 to 5 till we reach the last position.\n6. If the number was not found, return `-1`.\n\n> **Linear Search Algorithm**: Congratulations, we've just written our first _algorithm_! An algorithm is simply a list of statements which can be converted into code and executed by a computer on different sets of inputs. This particular algorithm is called linear search, since it involves searching through a list in a linear fashion i.e. element after element.\n\n\n**Tip:** Always try to express (speak or write) the algorithm in your own words before you start coding. It can be as brief or detailed as you require it to be. Writing is a great tool for thinking clearly. It's likely that you will find some parts of the solution difficult to express, which suggests that you are probably unable to think about it clearly. The more clearly you are able to express your thoughts, the easier it will be for you to turn into code.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.

Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.\n\nRecall this statement from  original question: _\"Alice challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by **turning over as few cards as possible**.\"_ We restated this requirement as: _\"Minimize the number of times we access elements from the list `cards`\"_\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mazym6s.png\" width=\"480\">\n\nBefore we can minimize the number, we need a way to measure it. Since we access a list element once in every iteration, for a list of size `N` we access the elements from the list up to `N` times. Thus, Bob may need to overturn up to `N` cards in the worst case, to find the required card. \n\nSuppose he is only allowed to overturn 1 card per minute, it may take him 30 minutes to find the required card if 30 cards are laid out on the table. Is this the best he can do? Is a way for Bob to arrive at the answer by turning over just 5 cards, instead of 30?\n\nThe field of study concerned with finding the amount of time, space or other resources required to complete the execution of computer programs is called _the analysis of algorithms_. And the process of figuring out the best algorithm to solve a given problem is called _algorithm design and optimization_.\n\n\n### Complexity and Big O Notation\n\n> **Complexity** of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size e.g. `N`. Unless otherwise stated, the term _complexity_ always refers to the worst-case complexity (i.e. the highest possible time/space taken by the program/algorithm to process an input).\n\nIn the case of linear search:\n\n1. The _time complexity_ of the algorithm is `cN` for some fixed constant `c` that depends on the number of operations we perform in each iteration and the time taken to execute a statement. Time complexity is sometimes also called the _running time_ of the algorithm.\n\n2. The _space complexity_ is some constant `c'` (independent of `N`), since we just need a single variable `position` to iterate through the array, and it occupies a constant space in the computer's memory (RAM).\n\n\n> **Big O Notation**: Worst-case complexity is often expressed using the Big O notation. In the Big O, we drop fixed constants and lower powers of variables to capture the trend of relationship between the size of the input and the complexity of the algorithm i.e. if the complexity of the algorithm is `cN^3 + dN^2 + eN + f`, in the Big O notation it is expressed as **O(N^3)**\n\nThus, the time complexity of linear search is **O(N)** and its space complexity is **O(1)**.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Save and upload your work to Jovian\n\nWhether you're running this Jupyter notebook online or on your computer, it's essential to save your work from time to time.
